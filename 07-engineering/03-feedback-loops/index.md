# Feedback Loops: Positive & Negative 

Part of a control system in which the outputs are fed back in as inputs. Take the heating in your home: your furnace will push out heat, the thermometer will check the temperature and use this information to turn the furnace on and off. The system is a loop. The concept is also known as homeostatis.
