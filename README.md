# List of Mental Models

This repository hosts the content of the Mental Models, soon to be published for [https://wisecharlie.com](https://wisecharlie.com).

## What are Mental Models?

Mental models are big ideas from big disciplines, like business, psychology, science, engineering, and so on. An understanding of the key concepts from these multi-disciplinary topics will teach you to be an independent thinker.

## Why are Mental Models important?

Mental Models help us think independently by asking the right questions in order to solve problems or reach for highest conviction that rely on facts instead of an opinion. 

A mental model is a representation of an external reality inside your head – a kind of cognitive map. The purpose of mental models is to gain and understand knowledge about the world through key multidisciplinary concepts — something schools don't teach. The closer you get your cognitive processes (the way your brain approaches a problem) to reality, the better the decisions you’ll make in life.

If you want to be a world-class thinker, you must develop a mind that can jump boundaries from one discipline to another.

Every discipline topic and a mental model has its folder.

The folder is named like `N-url`, where `N` is a number for the sorting purposes and `url` is the URL part with title of the material.

The type of the material is defined by the file inside the folder:

  - `index.md` stands for a mental model description
