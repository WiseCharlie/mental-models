# Evolution by Natural Selection

An evolutionary process where living things, over generations, adapt to changes in their environment. This includes, but is not limited to; food, mates, climate, predators, and weather. Those which are better able to adapt to those changes will reproduce in greater numbers and pass on favorable traits.
