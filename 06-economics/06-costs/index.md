# Costs: Opportunity Cost,Â Sunk Costs, Relevant Costs and Marginal Costs

Opportunity cost is the cost of doing one thing over another,
such as staying in vs. going out. Sunk costs are costs which cannot be recovered. Relevant costs are costs which will make a difference in decisions. Marginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit of a product or service.
