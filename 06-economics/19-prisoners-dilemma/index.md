# Prisoners' Dilemma

A game in which two separate prisoners are given two choices: confess or donâ€™t confess. If they both confess, they each get 2 years in prison. If neither confesses, they each get 1 year. If one confesses and the other does not, the confessor goes free and the other gets 3 years.
