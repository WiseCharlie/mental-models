# Stress-Influence

Here we learn mental models extracted from the field of Psychology. 

Stress can be both good and bad for us. Under stress, we can complete tasks and have an enhanced focus for a short period of time. Yet stress can also lead us to act without thinking. Constant stress can affect our health. Light stress, on the other hand, can improve our performance.
