# Drug-Misinfluence

Here we learn mental models extracted from the field of Psychology. 

Drugs or alcohol can throw us into a spiraling negative-feedback loop which can become self-reinforcing and impossible to escape from. We can be influenced to make big mistakes, so we should stay away from the big mistake (the drugs), in the first place.
