# Influence-from-Mere Association

Here we learn mental models extracted from the field of Psychology. 

A conditioned reflex where a response is triggered by an association. You may have experiences where spending more has resulted in higher quality goods, so you seek out more expensive goods. You may buy a product with a cat on the packaging because you love cats.
