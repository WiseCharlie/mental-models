# Survivorship Bias

Here we learn mental models extracted from the field of Psychology. 

We tend to focus on the survivors and the winners for our information and discount the losers. If there are many successful bars in your area you may think about opening one yourself, but the bars which failed are invisible to you, their information is lost.
