# Pavlovian Conditioning/Classical Conditioning

Here we learn mental models extracted from the field of Psychology. 

Learning to associate a conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus. Pavlovâ€™s experiments proved this. He would ring a bell (conditioned) every time he gave food (unconditioned, food causes salivation) to his dogs. Over time the dogs would salivate (unconditioned) when the bell was rung (conditioned).
