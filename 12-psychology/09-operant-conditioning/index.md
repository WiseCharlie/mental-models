# Operant Conditioning

Here we learn mental models extracted from the field of Psychology. 

A type of conditioning where behaviors are learned and encouraged through rewards for good behavior and punishment for bad behavior. If you work hard in your job you receive a paycheck and are motivated to continue this behavior. If you donâ€™t work hard the paycheck could be taken away.
