# Reciprocation Theory

Here we learn mental models extracted from the field of Psychology. 

Reciprocation is the act of doing something nice for someone, with the expectation that they will do something nice in return for you. One form of reciprocity is the idea of reciprocal concessions in which the requester lowers his/her initial request making the respondent more likely to agree to a second request.
