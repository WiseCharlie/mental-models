# Laws of Thermodynamics

Consists of four laws. 1. If two systems are independently equal, thermally, to a third, the two systems must be equal to each other. 2. The total amount of energy in a closed system cannot change. 3. The disorder of energy in a closed system will always increase. 4. It is impossible to reach absolute zero.
